  //     'I explored various machine learning and deep learning models, focusing on understanding their architectures, functions, and key parameters. I worked extensively with PyTorch, analyzing how its models could be effectively used in practical applications. My main goal was to integrate these models into a user-friendly UI. I designed an interface that allows users to easily interact with and visualize model outputs. This helped bridge the gap between model complexity and real-world usability.',
